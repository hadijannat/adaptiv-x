abstract: >-
  A deployment-ready reference implementation of a cognitive Industrial
  Digital Twin that actively renegotiates its own skills at runtime based
  on continuously re-evaluated health and feasibility. Implements hybrid AI
  (ML + FMU physics), semantic capability reasoning, and VDI/VDE 2193-inspired
  bidding for capability-based production routing.
